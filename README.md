# Retirements_epidemiology_ATP_WTA_Tour

# Manuscript submited in xxxx
Originally, this is the repository for the manuscript _"Retirements of professional tennis players in elite tournaments"_ that is submited in the 
journal [xxx](https://www.xxxxx). The aim of this work was to analyse the epidemiological pattern of retirements suffered by professional tennis players in elite tournament matches (ATP and WTA) during the period 1973-2019, and relate the match factors that influence retirement. In this way, a large-scale study is carried out to describe which match factors and which player characteristics influence retirements and results are compared between ATP and WTA, an analysis not carried out to our knowledge by anyone to date.
